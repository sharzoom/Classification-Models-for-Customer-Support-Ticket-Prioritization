# Classification-Models-for-Customer-Support-Ticket-Prioritization
Efficient customer support ticket prioritization
plays a pivotal role in ensuring timely
and effective responses to critical issues,
thereby elevating overall customer satisfaction
and loyalty. This process optimizes the
allocation of support resources, facilitating
the resolution of customer concerns in
a manner that aligns with Service Level
Agreements (SLAs) and cultivates positive
customer relations, while averting potential
penalties. This project undertakes a comprehensive
exploration of the performance
of various classification models—such as
Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random
Forest, and Na¨ıve Bayes—in the context of
customer support ticket prioritization.
Our primary objective is the development
and evaluation of a classification model
that demonstrates both robustness and
scalability in the prioritization of customer
support tickets. Through this investigation,
we seek to contribute insights that can
enhance the efficiency of customer support
processes and ultimately elevate the overall
quality of customer service delivery.
